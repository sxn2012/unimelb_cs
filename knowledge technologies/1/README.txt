This README file describes the program function in project 1 of COMP90049 2019S2.
The program contains two files. The language used for programming is Python. The version of Python used to run the program is Python 3.5.2.

-test.py: This file is used to extract lexical blends from blends.txt in order to help evaluate the system. The result of this program is stored in 1.txt.

-demo.py: This is the most important file of this project. It first reads data from dictionary.txt and candidates.txt and detects the blend words in candidates.txt. Then, the system conducts the evaluation process. It compares the blend detection results with the true blends stored in 1.txt. Thus, the evaluation metrics can be calculated correctly.

-README.MD: This is the file that you are currently reading. It describes how the program works.
