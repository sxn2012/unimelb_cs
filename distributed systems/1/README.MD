# DS2019S2_Assignment1
This is my assignment of designing and implementing Multi-threaded Dictionary Server implemented in Java, and users can use the dictionary in the computer simultaneously in the graphical user interface (GUI), including:
<br>➢ query the meaning of a given word
<br>➢ add a new word into the dictionary
<br>➢ remove the existing word from the dictionary

<br><br>Using "java –jar DictionaryServer.jar <port> <dictionary-file>" to open server jar packages.
<br><br>Using "java –jar DictionaryClient.jar <server-address> <server-port>" to open client jar packages.
<br>Need JDK 1.8 or higher version.
